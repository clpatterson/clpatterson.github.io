<p>Four weeks of (Virtual) Recurse Center will have pasted Friday. How has the experience been so far? Am I getting the most out of RC? What have I done? How have I done it? How could things be better or worse?</p>
<p>What have I accomplished at RC so far?</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a cli interface to my recursive BigQuery table parser utility.</li>
<li>Completed OOP style TicTacToe, got a code review, and implemented the feedback.</li>
<li>Completed Conway’s Game of Life…yet to be submitted for a code review…</li>
<li>Read about stacks and begin reading about queues in my data structures and algorithms book.</li>
<li>Completed a handful of Python challenges on Codewars and leveled up from 8 kyu to 7 kyu.</li>
<li>Completed my first Leet Code challenge and then improved my solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>What else have I accomplished?</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve been navigating my learning in a thorough way. I have read quite a few articles on RealPython, GeeksforGeeks, and W3schools whenever I don’t understand my code or want to solidify my understanding of Python.</li>
<li>I have produced copious notes for myself in a series called “What I know about Python <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.” In this series, I take notes on things I’m using and learning as I code. So far I have notes on standard library modules/functions, ecosystem modules/functions, built-in functions, operators, data structures, and looping constructs.</li>
<li>I gave my first technical talk on Python list comprehensions.</li>
<li>I’ve had coffee chats with Recursers almost every day.</li>
<li>I’ve attended different RC groups and events and done a decent job of balancing my learning with staying involved in the community (though I do wonder if I’m striking the right balance from time to time…but this seems typical for people in batch.)</li>
<li>Began assembling notes on Repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI) and things I can do to prevent them.</li>
</ul>
<p>What am I doing well?</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m making consistent progress on my projects and learning goals (even if some days are more productive than others).</li>
<li>I’m getting back into productive procrastinating (a skill I honed in college, but seem to have forgotten) where I shift to another task on my list when I can’t find the motivation to work on what I “should be working on”.</li>
<li>I’m participating in the community on Zulip, but not being distracted by it.</li>
<li>I’m doing a decent job of balancing RC and my relationship.</li>
<li>Cooking healthy meals, keeping the apartment neat, assembling furniture, keeping up with friends and family, organizing/participating in socially distanced (read mostly digital) events with friends.</li>
<li>Reading and listening to books more than I’m watching tv.</li>
<li>Going outside and taking breaks when I feel myself being unproductive.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I could improve upon?</p>
<ul>
<li>There are certainly things I could improve upon. But now that I have reached this section, I don’t really feel like listing or thinking about these. I’ve been cooped up for over a month now and I’m feeling good about how I’ve adapted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Till next time.</p>
